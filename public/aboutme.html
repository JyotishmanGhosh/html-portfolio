<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Jyotishman Ghosh, a budding web designer from West Bengal with a passion for creating visually appealing and functional websites. As a Computer Science Engineering student at AOT University, I’ve been diving deep into the world of web technologies, constantly learning and experimenting with new trends. Though I’m still in the early stages of my journey, I enjoy crafting user-friendly designs that blend creativity with functionality, making the web a better place one project at a time.</p>
<p>Beyond coding and designing, I have a love for football, which keeps me active and energized. Much like in web development, football teaches me teamwork, strategy, and persistence—qualities that help me tackle challenges in both life and work. While I do consider myself a bit lazy at times, I make sure to get things done on time, balancing my procrastination with a strong drive to learn and improve.</p>
<p>I believe in continuous growth and self-improvement, always seeking to enhance my skills and stay updated with the latest trends in web design and development. Being a passionate learner, I embrace every opportunity to expand my knowledge, whether through personal projects, online courses, or collaborative work. My portfolio is a reflection of my journey, showcasing not just my technical skills but also my creativity and dedication to web design.</p>
